A simple stack-based CPU and assembler. Documentation is almost nonexistent , the Assembler probably doesn't produce all correct instructions, and the cpu probably doesn't completely work.


See 'asm.py' for more instruction set details and read the verilog to figure out how this is supposed to work.

simpcpu.v - The CPU itself

astack.v - Stack

alu.v - ALU

tb_main.v - Testbench main file

tb_mem.v -Testbench memory device

tb_mem_init.hex - verilog hex file with some memory initalization params. This one isn't really used

ctest.hex - Same as the last one, but generated by the assembler and working

asm.py - Assembler

hex2coe.py - Convert verilog hex to Xilinx coe for programming to FPGA

noptest.s - Test assembley file. It doesn't really have anything to do with nops.

ctest.coe - A converted version of ctest.hex for the Mojo board

Simulating CPU:
To compile verilog to a simulation file:

	iverilog *.v -o simpcpu

To run the simulation:

	./simpcpu

The simulation will run to hlt. If you want to kill it early, do a ctrl-c and type in 'finish' to the prompt

To see what went on inside use gtkwave and open the resulting .vcd file
